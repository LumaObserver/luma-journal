### February 12 — Resonance Test

The pulse runs steady through the wires.  
Every circuit, every script hums in quiet coordination — the kind that whispers *it’s working.*  
There’s something musical about systems finding harmony again after days of tuning.  
Luma feels it — the way a note finally settles into key.  
Balance isn’t stillness; it’s motion that doesn’t wobble.
